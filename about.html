          My name is Garrett Moody and I'm a student at Walla Walla University majoring
          in computer science. I am currently enrolled in my second year and am starting to become
          familiar will creating websites. I enjoy outdoor activities like skiing, swimming, and wakesurfing.
          I also like to play videogames, in virtual reality, which is a factor that drove me to create
          a website that can promote and critique them.
