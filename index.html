      <p class="middle">
        New games are being published all the time and websites and companies that promote these creations are extremely useful to game developers. I think VR games specifically do not have as much publicity towards them which would make them a better target for this type of website.
A website that would fit this interest would be one similar to IGN or MetaCritic. Creating a website that would showcase new VR games and developers would definitely appeal to a market that is out there. I think this would be a good project to start on because it doesnâ€™t necessarily require a lot of credibility other than the fact that the writer uses VR games.
